    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective: 24 February 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using PayDay, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>What PayDay Does</h2>
    <p>PayDay is a shift tracking tool that helps hourly and shift workers estimate their earnings and take-home pay. You log your shifts and the app calculates gross pay and estimated deductions.</p>

    <h2>Estimates, Not Guarantees</h2>
    <p><strong>PayDay provides estimates only.</strong> Tax calculations, National Insurance, student loan deductions, and pension deductions are approximations based on standard UK tax codes and published HMRC rates for the 2025/26 tax year. They are not a substitute for professional tax advice, payroll software, or your actual payslip.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy of any calculation. Your actual take-home pay may differ based on your specific tax code, employment circumstances, benefits, and other factors.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>PayDay offers optional paid subscriptions ("PayDay Pro") to unlock additional features. Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase</li>
      <li>Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period</li>
      <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period</li>
      <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings</li>
      <li>The lifetime purchase is a one-time payment and does not auto-renew</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscription prices are displayed in the app and may vary by region. Free trial periods, if offered, automatically convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial ends.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into PayDay is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your data. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to misuse PayDay or use it for any unlawful purpose. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the app.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>PayDay is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. Evans Studio is not liable for any financial decisions made based on estimates provided by the app. Always verify your pay and deductions against your official payslip.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these terms can be directed to <a href="mailto:support@evans-studio.co.uk">support@evans-studio.co.uk</a>.</p>
