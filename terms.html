    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 24 February 2026</p>

    <p>By using PayDay ("the App"), you agree to these terms. The App is developed by Evans Studio.</p>

    <h2>What the App Does</h2>
    <p>PayDay is a shift tracking tool that estimates your earnings and take-home pay based on information you provide. It is designed for hourly and shift workers who want a quick view of what they will earn.</p>

    <h2>Estimates, Not Exact Figures</h2>
    <p><strong>All pay calculations, tax deductions, National Insurance, student loan, and pension figures shown in the App are estimates only.</strong> They are based on standard UK tax codes (1257L) and published HMRC rates for the 2025/26 tax year. They may not reflect your actual deductions.</p>
    <p>The App is not a payroll system, tax calculator, or financial advice tool. For accurate figures, refer to your payslip or contact HMRC directly.</p>
    <p>Evans Studio accepts no liability for decisions made based on figures shown in the App.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>PayDay offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions ("PayDay Pro") that unlock additional features.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
      <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
      <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A one-time lifetime purchase option is also available and does not auto-renew.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>All data you enter is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your shift data, earnings, or personal information. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You may use the App for personal, non-commercial shift tracking. You may not reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute the App.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Evans Studio does not guarantee the accuracy of any calculations. Use the App at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions? Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@evansstudio.co.uk">support@evansstudio.co.uk</a>.</p>

    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. For subscriptions, Apple's Standard EULA also applies where not overridden by these terms.</p>
